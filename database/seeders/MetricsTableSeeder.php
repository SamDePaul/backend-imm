If the average wages paid to both groups on average were the same, the ratio would be 1. Organizations should use Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to disaggregate these groups. \n\nThis ratio can be calculated based on salaried employees with fixed wages or on employees with variable salaries (such as hourly, daily, weekly, other specified time cycle, or other specified parameter).\n\nOrganizations should footnote the specific position used in calculating this ratio, including whether the position is a managerial or non-managerial role. Organizations reporting this metric for multiple positions are encouraged to report these various data points for historically marginalized wage equity and to specify the position to which each data point corresponds.\n\nWhile this metric helps organizations begin to understand historically marginalized wage equity in their operations, organizations are cautioned that other factors may affect the data collected. For example, the average wages reported for this metric may only be meaningful if multiple individuals both within and without groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity have similar positions within the organization. Employee education, experience, and tenure at the organization, among other factors, may also influence wage disparities.\n\nThis metric is multidimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

A theory of change (also referred to as a Theory of Value Creation or Logic Model) expresses the sequence of cause-and-effect actions or occurrences by which organizational and financial resources are hypothesized to convert into the desired social and environmental results. It provides a conceptual roadmap for how an organization expects to achieve its intended impact. Often displayed in a diagram, many theories of change can be expressed as a series of if–then statements, specifying what the organization does and the expected results of each activity. A framework built around the concepts of activities, inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts is called a Logic Model or Impact Value Chain. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information and resources.\n\nWherever possible, organizations’ theories of change should refer to relevant IRIS metrics.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to footnote information on the defined outcomes they seek to achieve for their targeted stakeholders (e.g., clients, employees, distributors, suppliers, and/or the environment). Defined outcomes include specific targets that can be measured. Many are based on existing literature. Organizations are encouraged to footnote information on the evidence base that substantiates the logic chain linking outputs to defined outcomes. This evidence base might include credible secondary research, randomized control trials (RCT), longitudinal studies, primary research (such as customer surveys or stakeholder feedback forums), and qualitative interviews or case studies.\n\nFor example, an organization that provides training to and sources from smallholder farmers might only report on the number of farmers trained (Individuals Trained: Total [PI2998]), the number of smallholder farmers sourced from (Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI9991]), and the total payments made to those farmers (Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI7852]). However, its theory of change might describe how these outputs lead to outcomes, such as helping farmers build larger and more productive farms, and impacts, such as improved livelihoods, pointing to external research that supports this connection.",

Community engagement strategies involve intentional approaches to align the development priorities of local communities with the goals of the organization.\n\nExamples of strategy elements, to footnote, may include: providing deliberate resources (e.g., employee time and skills, in-kind giving, leadership) to community organizations or individuals, providing education and skills training, creating opportunities for employee volunteering and fundraising, contracting to local suppliers, lobbying to strengthen local issues, facilitating discussions with local leaders, integrating the company's community engagement activities into organizational functions, creating institutional policies and incentives for community engagement, and measuring the social impact of the organization's community engagement activities.\n\nThe strategy may also dictate methods (e.g., memoranda of understanding) for considering, informing, and consulting with existing community groups before implementing organizational activities that affect the community. For example, organizations may assess and take into account existing formal, informal, and historic land-use rights of local communities or Indigenous peoples prior to operations that affect the land.\n\nHistorical land titles offer one way to evaluate which communities to engage. LandMark (http://www.landmarkmap.org/) provides data on Indigenous and community land rights.

Organizations should footnote details on the training(s) provided, including the type. \n\nThis metric is useful in calculating GRI Disclosure 404-1: Average hours of training per year per employee. In the context of this GRI standard, ‘training’ refers to all types of vocational training and instruction, paid educational leave provided by an organization for its employees, training or education pursued externally and paid for in whole or in part by an organization, and training on specific topics. Training does not include on-site coaching by supervisors.\n\nOrganizations may use Full-Time Employees: Total (OI3160) and Part-Time Employees: Total (OI8864) to disaggregate this metric. Organizations are also encouraged to calculate this indicator for Temporary Employees (OI9028). Organizations may choose to use Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to disaggregate this metric by gender, race/ethnicity, disability, or other groupings.",

To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.”\n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on defining low-income areas. \n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.\n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\n\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact).

                'usage_guidance' => "This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations during the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \n\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.” \n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact.

Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects. \n\nOrganizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party and directly related to operations and maintenance of company.” To align to the HIPSO indicator Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction), organizations should include only the data for Jobs Type (OD0660) options “Permanence: Temporary (One-Time)” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party, but not directly related to operations and maintenance of company.”\n\nThe three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.\n\nDirect jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).\n\nWhile this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \n\nThis metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

For other Units of Measure, refer to Unit of Measure (PD1602).\n\nTo disaggregate this total by the type of energy generated for sale—for example, non-renewable vs. renewable sources—report this metric disaggregated by the relevant options from Primary Energy Source (OI3781).  \n\nOrganizations interested in reporting energy production at the product level should report Energy Capacity of Products Sold (PD1504), Energy Capacity of Product (PD2713), or both. \n\nOrganizations wishing to report the amount of energy generated for their own use should instead report Energy Generated for Use: Total (OI9624).\n\nIn some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

                'usage_guidance' => "This metric is intended to capture how organizations operating in microfinance (and primarily those providing lending services) deliver financial services.\n\nWith an individual lending methodology, a loan is made to an individual borrower who is solely responsible for its repayment.\n\nWith a solidarity group lending methodology, funds are disbursed to groups, with collection of repayment either from the group as a whole or from the individual members of that group. Borrowers in such groups often bear joint and several liability for the repayment of all loans to the group and its members. See the glossary term for additional information.\n\nWith a village/self-help group lending methodology, the organization provides access to credit and savings services through group- or community-managed associations. The organization may lend to the group, which in turn uses the provided funds to lend to its members. See the glossary term for additional information.\n\nWith agency banking, the organization extends their branch network to more distributed populations (e.g., rural populations) via authorized agents (branchless banking). Benefits of this methodology include cost-effectiveness, risk management, product availability, improved financial inclusion, and a wider customer base.\n\nWith licensed agents, individuals or businesses are empowered to act on behalf of a financial service provider (FSP) to perform certain financial or administrative transactions. They may have a direct contractual relationship with the FSP or may be contracted by a third party (a super-agent or aggregator) that maintains a service agreement with the FSP.\n\nRoving staff/mobile branches serve customers outside of branches in their places of residence or business. They may or may not be associated with a particular branch. This methodology includes only staff or mobile units that manage deposits or handle opening customer accounts (other than loan origination).\n\nWith ATMs (automated teller machines), customers access services via machines at fixed locations through different means of identification (card, PIN, biometrics). ATMs offer different kinds of cash- or non-cash-based operations (such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account balance consultation). ATMs may be proprietary or managed by third parties.\n\nWith mobile banking, clients access services through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) or Short Message Service (SMS) communications via their mobile devices.\n\nWith Internet-based banking services, clients access services through a personal device (smartphone app or website) using standard Internet protocols.\n\nWith merchant POS (point-of-sale) or network, a merchant uses a physical payment processing device, located at the merchant’s place of business and connected to a network, to accept payment for the sale of goods or services from customers of the financial service provider using their means of identification from the FSP (card or other). The merchant could be owned directly by the FSP or simply have access to a network enabling the merchant to process payments.\n\nOrganizations using an ‘other’ approach to delivering microfinance should describe the method or approach used.\n\nOrganizations can refer to the following resources for additional guidance:\n\n-Microfinance Information Exchange: Measuring the Performance of Alternative Delivery Channels (https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/about/what-we-do/mix)\n\n-International Finance Corporation: Digital Finance (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Industry_EXT_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Financial+Institutions/Priorities/Digital+Finance)",

The value of  ecosystem services can be expressed in physical (e.g., amount of groundwater supplied in m³) or monetary terms.

Organizations may use this metric to disaggregate Water Discharged (OD0386) by volume of water treated. For sanitation-related investments, organizations should disaggregate and apply this calculation specifically to wastewater. \n\nTreating water aims to improve water’s quality to make it more acceptable for an end-use, such as drinking, industry, or safe return to the environment, by removing or reducing existing water contaminants. Increasing population pressure is increasing the amount of wastewater. Untreated effluent is discharged to water bodies and terrestrial ecosystems, leading to nutrient surpluses (which can cause anoxic conditions and species loss) and the presence of toxic, often non-degradable compounds in ecosystems. Untreated wastewater contains pathogens that can contaminate drinking water. Treating and recycling polluted water can help tackle water shortages.\n\nMinimum requirements for treatment might be specified by national, sub-national, or local legislation; in setting treatment levels, however, organizations should consider the impacts of their overall water discharge and the needs of other water users.

Biodiversity footprint can be assessed at the level of a product, a project, a site, or the entire organization. While it does not require time- and cost-intensive field surveys, this metric is not intended to offer an extremely accurate or holistic picture of biodiversity performance. Organizations can apply this metric in benchmarking (‘which companies in my portfolio are scoring well in terms of biodiversity?’), tracking progress to target (‘are companies in my portfolio evolving towards improved biodiversity performance?’), and comparison (‘which investment options are most promising in terms of biodiversity performance?’). \n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to apply standard indicators for biodiversity footprint. Typically based on a combination of extent (surface), condition, and significance of the local ecosystem, commonly applied condition indicators include Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF), often combined with surface metrics (e.g., MSA.ha or MSA per hectare). PDF expresses the (potential) loss of species, while MSA expresses the abundance of species remaining (MSA, as a measure of current intactness, is preferred for this IRIS indicator). These indicators are often normalized to fall between 0 and 1; with MSA, for instance, no biodiversity is left when MSA = 0, while a very pristine area has MSA = 1. Both MSA\nand PDF can be used across all sectors and across all countries and (eco)regions. For more on these measures as well as an overall discussion of the biodiversity footprint and its application to different asset classes, see the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF)’s “Paving the way towards a harmonised biodiversity accounting approach for the financial sector” (https://www.pbafglobal.com/about-pbaf#first-version-of-the-pbaf-standard). \n\nAvailable biodiversity measurement tools use models that include drivers of biodiversity loss such as land use changes, GHG emissions, and pollution.

Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. However, there are not, as of yet, broadly standardized ratios for the “quality of the intervention” element of the calculation. IRIS users are encouraged to document all assumptions used in calculating this measure as well as to use existing publications such as the following to inform their approaches: \n-	IADB’s \"The Use of Effective Coverage in the Evaluation of Maternal and Child Health Programs: A Technical Note for the IDB’s Social Protection and Health” (https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Use-of-Effective-Coverage-in-the-Evaluation-of-Maternal-and-Child-Health-Programs-A-Technical-Note-for-the-IDB-Social-Protection-and-Health-Division.pdf)\n-	“Effective coverage as a new approach to health system performance assessment: a scoping review” (https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3692-7#:~:text=In%20their%20work%2C%20effective%20coverage%20combines%20three%20widely,which%20is%20actually%20delivered%20%5B%201%2C%2010%20%5D). \n-	“Access, utilization, quality, and effective coverage: an integrated conceptual framework and measurement strategy” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953604006070?via%3Dihub).\n\nIn specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

Other organizations with a different target stakeholder might instead apply this metric to Supplier Individuals: Total (PI5350).\n\nThis indicator is based on and refers to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) developed by FAO’s Voices of the Hungry Project. The FIES is an experience-based measure of food insecurity severity that relies on people’s direct responses to questions about their experiences facing constrained access to food. The FIES can be used to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity at different levels of severity, which is key information for implementing policies that aim to realize the human right to food. The FIES Survey Module (FIES-SM) comprises eight questions regarding people's access to adequate food and can be easily integrated into various types of surveys. For more on FIES, including the questions translated into over 170 languages, link to SDG 2.1.2, and free data analysis tools, see FAO’s FIES website (https://www.fao.org/in-action/voices-of-the-hungry/background/en/).
